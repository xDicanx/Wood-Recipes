    <p>We would be remiss if we didn’t demonstrate the versatility of cannabis in the kitchen by showing you at least one savory cannabis recipe. This recipe pairs well with white wine for a higher-end cannabis dining experience. This is an interesting dish from a culinary standpoint because the herbs and citrus simultaneously tame and elevate the distinctive cannabis flavor, so it can work well with the delicate flavor of fish.</p>
    
    <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About 1 pound medium-sized whitefish filets</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This should be 4 to 6 filets of around 5 to 10” for most types of whitefish.</li>
                <li>Recommended whitefish for this recipe include cod, Alaskan pollock, grouper, and halibut.</li>
                <li>The fresher, the better, but try frozen tilapia if you’re on a budget.</li>
                <li>Although geared towards delicate whitefish, the same recipe can stand up to trout, salmon, or catfish, given a few adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 c cannabutter, melted</li>
            <li>Zest from 1 lemon (reserve fruit for juice)</li>
            <li>Juice from 1 lemon </li>
            <li>Additional lemons, sliced thinly</li>
            <li>1 t kosher salt, divided into two half-teaspoons</li>
            <li>1 T Old Bay seasoning blend (or experiment with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and other seasonings of your choice)</li>
            <li>A modest sprinkling of black pepper (freshly ground, if available)</li>
            <li>3 T olive oil (or additional cannabutter)</li>
            <li>1/8 c fresh chopped basil (or 2 t dried, crushed basil leaves)</li>
            <li>1/8 c fresh chopped parsley (or 2 t dried parsley flakes)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 420 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Filets should be skinless and boned to begin.</li>
            <li>Pat your fish filets completely dry with a paper towel. This would be of extra importance if you started with frozen products. Ensure every filet is completely thawed before continuing.</li>
            <li>Mix the melted butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and 1/2 t of salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate container, mix the remaining 1/2 t salt with your dry seasonings (Old Bay, black pepper, etc.)</li>
            <li>Use the dry spice mix as a rub to adequately season each side of each filet.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the bottom of an adequately large baking dish. You can use more cannabutter if desired.</li>
            <li>Layer the sliced lemons on the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place the filets on top of the lemons. Do not overlap any of the fish filets; cook in multiple batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the fish flakes nicely with a fork. Thinner filets may need even less time than that.</li>
            <li>If a garnish is desired, use additional sliced lemons and parsley sprigs when plating.</li>
        </ol>
