    <p>There is no cannabis treat more iconic than the THC-infused brownie. The cannabis brownie has become ubiquitous for two reasons. First, the rich, bold flavors of chocolate are great at covering up the earthy cannabis taste. Second, and most importantly, brownies are delicious!</p>

            <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>

            <li>In another mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, cannabutter, soda, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients slowly, stirring lightly. Combine the mixtures but do not attempt to make the batter smooth. Do not use an electric mixer./li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your greased pan, spreading evenly with a spoon or spatula if needed.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a toothpick placed into the center of the pan comes out clean of crumbs and residue.</li>
